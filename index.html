        <h1>My Web Dev Coding Journey</h1>
            <h2>Day 2 - August 30, 2023</h2> <i>(Because we only started coding in HTML today.)</i>
                <!-- This is the practical uses of what I've learned so far, as well as the assignment part. It's also nice to keep a journal of my journey with me. -->
            <p>Today, we finally started coding our first website. Well, this is not <em>the first website</em> I've made. I've made several "first" websites in my life and I have this one because I'm starting again afresh on my web dev career path. If only I could practice, learn, and code all day long, up until I start learning something new. In any case, I'm here and I'm starting again. I hope I'm not starting too late, because the future, our (28M 25F) future will depend on it.</p>
            
            <p>So far, we talked about paragraph, headings, strong and emphasis, nesting elements, and comments, all of which I already know. We also have lists, which I also know, but for the assignment:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>An unordered shopping list of your favorite foods</b></li>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Pepperoni Pizza</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>ingredients to make dough</li>
                        <li>tomato sauce and paste</li>
                        <li>fresh cheese</li>
                        <li>savory sausages for the pepperoni ('cause pepperoni isn't readily available here)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Pasta (Carbonara)</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>pasta</li>
                        <li>egg</li>
                        <li>cheese</li>
                        <li>ham and bacon (I know the proper meat but also not readily available here)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Potatoes (mash, fried, or what have you)</li>
                    </ul><br>
                <li><b>An ordered list of todo's you need to get done today</b></li>
                    <ol>
                    <li>do laundry</li>
                    <li>learn more about coding</li>
                    <li>pick bibi up after work</li>
                    <li>play some games as downtime</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>An unordered list of places you'd like to visit someday</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li>S. Korea (for bibi)</li>
                    <li>Japan</li>
                    <li>Rome, Italy</li>
                    <li>Palawan</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>An ordered list of your all time top 5 favorite video games or movies</li>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Half-Life</li>
                    <li>Valheim</li>
                    <li>The Elder Scrolls</li>
                    <li>Fallout</li>
                    <li>Red Dead Redemption</li>
                    </ol>
            </ol>
            <p>Moving on from lists, we also have links and images, which I also know. I remember where we had to link webpages and have them load on a particular part of the index file. Those were fun times during high school. To think that everything I was taught back then would still be active right now. Of course we did do it on notepad, but it was part of the fun, trying to debug the code when something messed up. Fun times hehe. Anyways, here's the link to work on that section: <a href="odin-links-and-images/index-for-links-images.html">Odin Links and Images</a></p>

            <h2>Day 3 - September 1, 2023</h2>
                <!-- This is finally the start of the actual dev blog. -->
            <p>Last time, I already started the first project, which was Odin's Recipes. I filled it with recipes from Valheim, a game my fiance and I play a lot (plus it has that viking theme already). I finished up that project today and submitted it to Odin.</p>
            <p>I had a couple of hiccups, though. Like the files not pushing to GitHub and missing blobs. I was definitely dumbfounded but luckily Google was there and so were the strangers that had that similar problem before (thanks strangers!). Now I know how to re-hash files if ever they're corrupt (did I get that right?) Apparently my laptop BSOD-ed itself, corrupting my files. A little panic, but was able to go through with it.</p>
            <p>Today, we start with CSS, and hopefully I do it right this time. Because when I had a go with it, I got it pretty well, but my designed were uuuuuugly. Hopefully they got better as the years went by.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Day 5 (?) - September 6, 2023</h2>
            <p>I haven't had any real time to study coding up until now. I was busy focusing on looking for a part-time while I study. I have a wedding to save up for hehe</p>
            <p>Anyway, I finished forking the CSS exercises from GitHub and I'll now focus on them. Updates later.</p>
            <p><b>Updates:</b><br> 01-css-methods was done without any hitch.<br> 02-class-id-selectors got a small mistake. I was supposed to add a general class to some elements, but I figured that since they were all paragraphs, I would just use paragraph. Optimized but didn't follow the code. Also, I could've used a class with one of the ID items. I forgot that you can still add classes even if some items have IDs. <br>
            03-grouping-selectors also hit a snag. I chained the selectors instead of gruping them. <br>
            04-chaining-selectors was good. I got it thanks to the mistake in exercise 3.<br><br>
            I had to stop there because I needed to rest. Till next time!
