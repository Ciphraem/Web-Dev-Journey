                <h2>Day 2 - August 30, 2023</h2> <i>(Because we only started coding in HTML today.)</i>
                    <!-- This is the practical uses of what I've learned so far, as well as the assignment part. It's also nice to keep a journal of my journey with me. -->
                <p>Today, we finally started coding our first website. Well, this is not <em>the first website</em> I've made. I've made several "first" websites in my life and I have this one because I'm starting again afresh on my web dev career path. If only I could practice, learn, and code all day long, up until I start learning something new. In any case, I'm here and I'm starting again. I hope I'm not starting too late, because the future, our (28M 25F) future will depend    alert(And the winner is the)nesting elements, and comments, all of which I already know. We also have lists, which I also know, but for the assignment:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>An unordered shopping list of your favorite foods</b>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Pepperoni Pizza
                            <ul>
                            <li>ingredients to make dough</li>
                            <li>tomato sauce and paste</li>
                            <li>fresh cheese</li>
                            <li>savory sausages for the pepperoni ('cause pepperoni isn't readily available here)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Pasta (Carbonara)
                            <ul>
                            <li>pasta</li>

                            <li>ham and bacon (I know the proper meat but also not readily available here)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Potatoes (mash, fried, or what have you)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>An ordered list of todo's you need to get done today</b>

                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>An unordered list of places you'd like to visit someday</b>
                        <ul>

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Moving on from lists, we also have links and images, which I also know. I remember where we had to link webpages and have them load on a particular part of the index file. Those were fun times during high school. To think that everything I was taught back then would still be active right now. Of course we did do it on notepad, but it was part of the fun, trying to debug the code when something messed up. Fun times hehe. Anyways, here's the link to work on that section: <a href="odin-links-and-images/index-for-links-images.html">Odin Links and Images</a></p>
                <br>
                <h2>Day 3 - September 1, 2023</h2>
                    <!-- This is finally the start of the actual dev blog. -->
                <p>Last time, I already started the first project, which was Odin's Recipes. I filled it with recipes from Valheim, a game my fiance and I play a lot (plus it has that viking theme already). I finished up that project today and submitted it to Odin.</p>
                <p>I had a couple of hiccups, though. Like the files not pushing to GitHub and missing blobs. I was definitely dumbfounded but luckily Google was there and so were the strangers that had that similar problem before (thanks strangers!). Now I know how to re-hash files if ever they're corrupt (did I get that right?) Apparently my laptop BSOD-ed itself, corrupting my files. A little panic, but was able to go through with it.</p>
                <p>Today, we start with CSS, and hopefully I do it right this time. Because when I had a go with it, I got it pretty well, but my designed were uuuuuugly. Hopefully they got better as the years went by.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Day 5 (?) - September 6, 2023</h2>
                <p>I haven't had any real time to study coding up until now. I was busy focusing on looking for a part-time while I study. I have a wedding to save up for hehe</p>
                <p>Anyway, I finished forking the CSS exercises from GitHub and I'll now focus on them. Updates later.</p>
                <b>Updates:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>01-css-methods was done without any hitch.</li> <li>02-class-id-selectors got a small mistake. I was supposed to add a general class to some elements, but I figured that since they were all paragraphs, I would just use paragraph. Optimized but didn't follow the code. Also, I could've used a class with one of the ID items. I forgot that you can still add classes even if some items have IDs. </li>
                        <li>03-grouping-selectors also hit a snag. I chained the selectors instead of gruping them. </li>
                        <li>04-chaining-selectors was good. I got it thanks to the mistake in exercise 3.</li>
                    </ul>
                    I had to stop there because I needed to rest. Till next time!
                <h2>Day 6 - September 7, 2023</h2>
                <p>I started with my job today while coding, so my schedule is going to be more stable than before. This probably means that I'll be more consistent in studying and practicing my code. Yay!</p>
                <p>Continuing for last time, I'll start with exercise 5.</p>
                <b>Updates:</b><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>05-descendant-combinator was done smoothly.</li>
                        <li>06-cascade-fix is also done.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Alright! I'm done with the CSS exercises. I'm ready to move on tomorrow.</p>
                <h2>Day 7 - September 8, 2023</h2>
                <p>I'm moving on to the Cascade in CSS. After reading the page, I found out that I was supposed to do exercise 06 during <em>THIS</em> part of the course. Should have read the instructions more carefully.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the assignment asked us to style the first project,Odin Recipes, and I did just that. I'm not done yet though, and I think I'll finish tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Day 8 - September 13, 2023</h2>
                <p>Currently sick at home. Decided to code after a few days not coding.</p>
                <p>Finished the CSS in project 1. It's just basic designing but I still have some ideas on how to make it better. As I learn more, hopefully I come back and edit them to become better.</p>
                <p>I've also finished the lessons involing the Dev Tools in browser. Very very very very help, to say the least. Definitely something I see myself seeing every day.</p>
                <p>I still need to code this journey. I'll probably do it some time. I'm thinking of having it like a journal or a scroll. At least something that really looks like a journey journal or memoir. Till next time!</p>

                <h2>Day 9 - September 18, 2023</h2>
                <p>Studied the Box Model today. Definitely would have been better if I knew about this before. Now I know the differences of margin, border, and padding, as well as the display attribute.</p>

                <h2>Day 10 - September 19, 2023</h2>
                <p>Just a quick lesson as I used most of my study time into bettering my budgeting sheet by including a table for each transaction, then automating the net received, the totals of net, total of trips made, payment method used by the customer, and, the computed cash based on the payment method. I then fixed some formulas to accomdate the changes.</p>
                <p>Right now, I'm still studying the Box of CSS, particularly Block and Inline.</p>
                Now, I'm doing the exercises for margin and padding.
                    <ul>
                        <li>01-margin-and-padding-1 was almost perfect. I learned that if you used [margin-left: auto;], elements would align to the right. </li>
                        <li>02-margin-and-padding-2 is still unfinished. Will continue tomorrow.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Day 11 - September 20, 2023</h2>
                <p>Finished the two exercises for the block. 02-margin-and-padding-2 needed a little work, but it was a good thing I learned about the Chrome Dev Tools. It was definitely helpful trying to figure out what was giving the weird spacing. Other than that, it went smoothly.</p>
                <p>Now the next assignment is to work on Project 1 to make it better, and that's what I'll focus on today.</p>

                <h2>Day 12 - September 21, 2023</h2>
                <p>Finished styling Project 1. Made me realize that a lot of the time I'm styling, making errors, fixing them, double-checking on the file it it appears correctly. I know there are some tools that will definitely make this a lot better, but for now, I'm happy that I could do it. It's made me happy to style a project.</p>
                <p>Now about styling this blog...?</p>

                <h2>Day 13 - September 22, 2023</h2>
                <p>I decided not to work today because of the pollution outside (you can definitely smell something wrong with the air), so I focused on taking a break and coding.</p>
                <p>I decided not to stylize my blog yet. I want to go learn more things. I'll add new styles and features along the way. And right now, I'm learning about flexbox (which is something I always read about when I google something for CSS).</p>

                <h2>Day 14 - September 23, 2023</h2>
                <p>Continuing to learn about Flexboxes. I've learned about the container and items, the 3 different properties, and the shorthand. Now I'm learning about Axes and the rest of Flexbox with other resources.</p>
                <p>On a side note, I'm checking the validity of my html. I read on one post on reddit how the validity of your html matters, so I"m checking to make sure everythings good. (And I found a lot that were not okay hahaha)</p>

                <h2>Day 16 - September 25, 2023</h2>
                <p>Did a little bit of learning yesterday. More about flexbox and about alignment, using flexbox's different properties.</p>
                <p>Today, I'll be doing the assignments assigned to flexbox.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>01-flex-center was easy enough.</li>
                    <li>02-flex-header was doable but I forgot the gap property. Instead I placed margins on the elements. Achieved the same thing, buut will there be consequences later on?</li>
                    <li>03-flex-header-2 was good. I could have optimized it by combining both the left and right parts of the header into one in CSS, but I wasn't thinking about that at that time.</li>
                    <li>04-flex-information was also good. I may have given more properties than the solution asked for but it made the work more detailed (which can be good or bad I guess, depending on the situation).</li>
                    <li>05-flex-modal: I'm having a little bit of a hard time trying to figure this one out. I haven't checked the solution yet, but I feel like mine is a mess. <i>Update: I didn't do too bad. I got the main solution even with the little details. I was just afraid that the solution looked more elegant; it was more or less the same.</i></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Couldn't finish today. Will finish tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Day 17 - September 26, 2023</h2>
                <p>Still doing the assignments. Here are the updates:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>06-flex-layout was definitely tricky. Finally found the reason why things worked out and solved it. I found out to better layout first before applying design. Layout was good, design was different from solution but still looked good. Also learned that you don't need placeholders to apply flex (saw that ul was used as flex containter).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I'll finish the last one tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Day 18 - September 27, 2023</h2>
                <p>I finished 07-flex-layout-2 without much problem. I was able to do it without any major trouble.</p>
                <p>And with that, the flexbox section is complete. It's time to move on to the CSS project: the Landing Page.</p>

                <h2>Day 19 - September28, 2023</h2>
                <p>Finished the 2nd project for TOP. It's a nice real-world scenario. I have a design to copy and I've built the website from scratch. So I made it from coding to designing, following a design (just like if I would follow a design made by someone else). And I'm proud of what I did.</p>
                <p>But of course, it's only HTML and CSS. There's no functionality yet, let alone being responsive. So I have still a lot to learn. And I'm actually excited to learn them.</p>
                <p>Next stop, Javascript!</p>

                <h2>Day 20 - October 2, 2023</h2>
                <p>Starting to relearn Javascript today. With already a background using C++ and Python, I should be able to go through this relatively quickly.</p>
                <p>Finished the first part, which is about basic math operations in coding. Pretty basic stuff but good to review.</p>

                <h2>Day 21 - October 3, 2023</h2>
                <p>Continuing with Javascript, I'm now studying about different data types and logic. Should be fun =)</p>
                <p>Also had a review of DevTools, now with Javascript. Definitely a good review.</p>

                <h2>Day 22 - October 4, 2023</h2>
                <p>Today will be about Javascript functions. There's a lot of reading material but I hope there's also a lot of practical exercises to work on.</p>
                <p>It's about function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, the return, call stacks, and many more. Not everything is covered but there's a lot to absorb on one study session.</p>
                <p>Finished the exercises and even went beyond by using things not mentioned in the instructions (like arrow functions and the prompt and alert).</p>

                <h2>Day 23 - October 10, 2023</h2>
                <p>Had a lot of time to rest and catch up with my family during my older sister's wedding. Now it's back to coding.</p>
                <p>Currently in the part about Problem Solving, un undeniably critical skill not just in web dev but in basically any programming language out there.</p>

                <h2>Day 24 - October 12, 2023</h2>
                <p>Still on Problem Solving. I'm currently watching a suggested video. It's definitely long, but helps me think like a programmer and some misconceptions about programming as a whole.</p>

                <h2>Day 25 - October 14, 2023</h2>
                <p>Continuing the video. Hoping to finish it today.</p>
                <p>I'm now on understanding errors, definitely helpful in debugging.</p>
                <p>We're starting our first javascript project: <strong>a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game.</strong> So excited hehe</p>

                <h2>Day 26 - October 20, 2023</h2>
                <p>Been sick so I've been studying on and off, but today I've made major progress. I've finished the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with extra features like the game finishes when someone reaches 5, announcements, alerts and prompts, and the use of functions. Ran into some problems but I managed to solve them along the way.</p>

                <h2>Day 27 - October 25, 2023</h2>
                <p>Studying up on arrays and loops (although I already know what they are). This'll be a nice refresher for me.</p>

                <h2>Day 28 - October 26, 2023</h2>
                <p>Still going through arrays and loops. Definitely needed this refresher. So many things I could think of when the exercises came hehe</p>
                <p>I'm doing some exercises and I'm getting stuck at the part where I have to filter an array using another array. I've got the answer from the web search but I"m trying to understand the logic behind the code. I'll figure it out tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Day 29 - October 27, 2023</h2>
                <p>Back at it again with the exercise. Turns out I misunderstood the filter() function. It's not removing the things in the filter, but keeping things that match the filter. Definitely made everything make sense.</p>
                <p>I also learned how to debug just JS in VSCode. Very helpful.</p>
                <p>I've finished the array and loop exercises, so I'll move on to the next lesson: DOM Manipulation and Events. This is new so I'm going to take it slow.</p>

                <h2>Day 30 - October 31, 2023</h2>
                <p>I'm still on the topic of DOMs. I've learned how to append, remove, and style different elements. I haven't tried to class and IDs, but I figured they're going to be the same way as CSS works, so I'll find that out later.</p>
                <p>Now, I'm at DOM events where I'll learn how to interact with the page.</p>

                <h2>Day 31 - up to November 6, 2023</h2>
                <p>I've been sick for the past days with a massive headache so I couldn't get anything done. But now I'm back and ready to learn more. I'm already behind my goals but I'm still making sure to catch up while still getting the important things done(like really learning instead of just doing the exercises).</p>
                <p>I'm still going through DOM events, so I'll focus on that for a while.</p>
                <p>DOM manipulation is definitely a bit lenghty, but it's what makes a website interactive. I'm still not done, but I'm definitely learning a lot.</p>

                <h2>Day 32 - November 7, 2023</h2>
                <p>Still going through DOM Events and Manipulation through JS.</p>
                <p><em>Frustration moment:</em> I was doing the activity where I needed to make a shopping list using html and js (that means entering an item, button functionality, appending and deleting list items, etc, a very useful exercise). I was getting frustrated why I couldn't get the value of the input field. After debugging and searching, I found out that for the input field, I need to use value instead of textContent. Searched why it has to be that, and it turns out since it's a field, I have to use value because textContent only looks at the string content of a node, which explains why I couldn't use it in the field. Made perfect sense and was able to get through that hurdle.</p>

                <h2>Day 33 - November 8, 2023</h2>
                <p>This will be a quick study session as there are still some preparations for our Pre-Nup that I have to do. I've finished the shopping list exercise for DOM Event and Manipulation.</p>

                <h2>Day 34 - up to November 13, 2023</h2>
                <p>Finished with DOM Manipulation and Events, although I have to say I'm not really confident with the whole of it. I hope I get more confident once I get more work and projects done.</p>
                <p>I'm now at the part where I'll add some UI to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game that I've previously made.</p>

                <h2>Day 40-ish - up to December 1, 2023</h2>
                <p>I've had to focus on work since the wedding is coming up and the budget was getting tight. I've been able to code a little bit throughout that time but I'm finally able to be back and focus up again.</p>
                <p>I've finished the fundamentals and I've chosen Ruby on Rails as my branch of study. Pretty interesting but I haven't seen yet how it's connected with Web Dev. I'm just starting out so the basic lessons again.</p>
                <p>Aside from that, I'm doing the <a href="https://100dayscss.com/">100 Days CSS Challenge</a> as well as <a href="https://javascript30.com/">Javascrip30</a> just to keep it fresh on my mind.</p>
                <p>I've focused on the CSS Challenge instead of the lesson today. That's okay because I learned about dates and format in JS trying to do the challenge. But next time, I'll focus on the lesson, then do the challenge when there's still time.</p>

                <h2>Day 41 - December 2, 2023</h2>
                <p>I'm following the lesson on conditional statements in Ruby. It's been quite a while since I read it, so I reviewed it again today.</p>

                <h2>---</h2>

                <h2>Day 42 - 9 June 2025</h2>
                <p>It's been two years since I last opened this file and continued learning to be a Web Developer. I'm trying to get back at it again. I'm still at the Ruby on Rails Introductory courses, so it's a good start for someone coming back after so much time passed.</p>
                <p>It's still my dream to be a web developer, with a new lean towards cybersecurity. But as always, I need to take that first step, that first job experience to really start going down that path. In the meantime, I need to continue learning what I can.</p>

                <h2>Day 44 - 12 June 2025</h2>
                <p>I finished Ruby on Rails Loops yesterday, and I finished Arrays today. Doing pretty good so far. Hopefully I will be consistent.</p>
                <p>CAREER UPDATE: Just the other day, I got the chance to apply for a 2-year developer training. It's a paid internship to become a developer and I want to be accepted so bad. I have an interview scheduled, and from what I searched, it's a pretty daunting application process. Applicants are assessed by technical skills. I know my own skills and I'm nervous because I haven't really put my skills up to any test or assessment. I'm going to look for techhnical skills assessments online so that I can have some experience, at least, before the official test.</p>
                <p>Had a little trouble with git. I forgot to fork the ruby exercises from The Odin Project and didn't make any repo for my personal practices. They merged in a folder, so I had to search how to push my personal practice while removing the ruby exercises from my repo. Went through a lot of searches (solution was actually easy) and cleaned up my repos. All's well that ends well!</p>

                <h2>Day 45 - 13 June 2025</h2>
                <p>I'm almost done with the lesson on hashes. I was still doing the ruby-exercises when I started feeling really nauseous. I was already feeling nauseous at the beginning of my study. Long story short, I ended up vomiting in the bathroom while doing the exercises. I've decided to stop for today and pick-up where I left tomorrow. Hopefully my headache goes away and I wake up feeling good and refreshed.</p>

                <h2>Day 46 - 15 June 2025</h2>
                <p>I woke up yesterday with a big headache. I had to take care of my little cutie-patootie all day with the headache, so it was quite a challenge. By the end of yesterday, I didn't have enough power to study, so I had to take a health break.</p>
                <p>Tonight, I finished the exercises for Hashes. I'll stop here so that I can do the next lesson in its entirety. I'll start with some coding gaems to keep the lessons I've learned fresh in my mind.</p>

                <h2>Day 47 - 16 June 2025</h2>
                <p>Started Methods in Ruby. Stopped at  the assignments and will continue around next week. I'll be on a retreat for the next three days, with an interview at the end of the three days. Will probably continue studying after that.</p>
                <p>I allotted some time to solving puzzles in CodinGame. I used Javascript as my main language because I really forgot how to code using JS. It's really helpful in keeping my brain sharp in looking for ways to solve problems. I have that interview coming up with the assessment, and I don't want to waste the opportunity.</p>

                <h2>Day 48 - 19 June 2025</h2>
                <p>I have the interview today. All the best for me! Hope I get it.</p>

                <h2>Day 49 - 23 June 2025</h2>
                <p>Finished Ruby methods today. I finished the activities in the assignments part of the lesson. It's actually pretty easy since methods is basically functions in other languages.</p>
                <p>About the interview: I can't go much into detail, but let's just say I had to make a simple functional program. The instructions were simple enough, but it was definitely my first time making something like that. And at first, it was something out of my league. We were allowed to use AI, but unfortunately it was my first time to use AI in coding. But I did my best anyway.</p>
                <p>I did the first part easily enough: set up the environment and dependencies for the function. It was so easy, I had time to study what the dependecies and each line of code was for. Since it was my first time in that area, AI was very helpful. The hard part was making the program actually function. It was complex to navigate and AI wasn't helpful. I was almost out of time when I finally ditched AI and did some good-old-fashioned Google Search. Sure enough, I found my answer in an old forum.</p>
                <p>When it finally functioned, it made me realize how stupid I was (no kidding). I was going after a different function, and AI can't even search it right and even straight-up told me it was impossible. After making it work, I had less than five minutes left. I saved, I pushed, and I contacted the intetrviewer. No more comments, no more tweaking, nothing. I was too afraid to run out of time. While waiting, I looked at the documentation of the function I needed. It was in an obscure spot, and since it's my first time in that area, my search algorithm didn't point me to that page. In the end, I did the demo, submitted the code, and hoped for the best. I really hope and pray I get this part. This is the step I need to shift careers.</p>
                <p>About the short gap in study: I had a little family vacation. Spent quality time with family. <3</p>

                <h2>Day 50 - 24 June 2025</h2>
                <p>Currently studying debugging in Ruby, including the use of pry-byebug and the study of the call stack. Didn't get enough hours into studying; had a lot of house chores to finish.</p>

                <h2>Day 51 - 24 June 2025, later in the evening</h2>
                <p>Finished the Debugging Course for Ruby a little early. I don't want to push into another course immediately, though I will have a peek. I'll continue on tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Day 52 - 26 June 2025</h2>
                <p>Finished reading the Enumerables lesson for Ruby. Will do the assignments tomorrow. Only had a short time for study because my wife and I had a little date. =)</p>

                <h2>Day 53 - 1 July 2025 - Early Morning</h2>
                <p>Took a few days break to relax, and now back to studying! Finished the assignment part of Enumerables for Ruby. Had some fun with the assignment. They weren't kidding about #reduce. I had to think a little bit longer for that one. I'll finish the day with some activities in CodinGame for JS, then call it a day.</p>

                <h2>Day 54 - 1 July 2025 - Late Night</h2>
                <p>I finished the Predicate Enumerables Method today. It's the same as enumerables, except for the return value being boolean. So it wasn't really anything new. Just more tools into the arsenal, and that's always good.</p>

                <h2>Day 55 - 3 July 2025</h2>
                <p>Almost done with nested arrays and hashes. Got stuck on the last exercise for returning a whole row of element if one of the elements inside passed the condition. Will return tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Day 56 - 4 July 2025</h2>
                <p>Finished the exercises for nested array. I totally forgot that the lesson had to exercises and I forgot to do the nested hashes exercises and went straigt for the first project. I'll do the nested hashes exercises next time.</p>
                <p>I already started on the first Ruby project (Caesar Cipher). I finished the initial user inputs, and I'll continue it after the nested hashes exercies.</p>

                <h2>Day 57 - 7 July 2025</h2>
                <p>Finished the Caesar Cipher project. Looking at my journal now, I see that I forgot the nested hashes exercises. I'll focus on that next time.</p>
                <p>About my cipher project, looking at others' code, I see that my code is clunky. I'll have to revisit in order to optimize it.</p>

                <h2>Day 58 - 9 July 2025</h2>
                <p>Finished the nested hashes exercises. Unexpectedly easier than nested arrays.</p>
                <p>Also finished cleaning up my Caesar Cipher project. Instead of the many 'ifs', I used a case statement. It made the whole thing so much cleaner. I also removed some redundant pieces of code.</p>
                <p>I've started the second project: Sub Strings. So far I'm doing a good job, but I'm a little stumped with counting those within the word. I'll continue it tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Day 59 - 10 July 2025</h2>
                <p>Finished the Sub Strings project for Ruby. I wanted to be able to store new words locally, but it seemed out of my league and I'm in no hurry to learn it now. I also think I'll come across the subject later in the future. For now, I learned to store in JSON and that I have to serialize my ruby class before adding or dumping it to the JSON file. I can also use Marshal, but I haven't checked how that would work out.</p>
                <p>Will start on the next lesson next time.</p>

                <h2>Day 60 - 11 July 2025</h2>
                <p>I finished something for my application for an internship, so I had only a little bit of study time. I started with the Stock Picker project. It's not working as intended yet, but I already imagined what I should be doing in order to make the code work. I should really pull out my sketchpad to visualize my thought floow.</p>

                <h2>Day 61 - 15 July 2025</h2>
                <p>Took a one-day break before the weekend because of a massive headache. I think it was a migraine because suddenly my sense of smell just went up to 500% sensitivity. And all strong smells were aweful.</p>
                <p>Finished with the Stock Picker project. The sketchpad was helpful. Another thing that was helpful was AI. Not to write the code, but to help me process my thoughts. It's like talking to a smarter self as I project my thoughs to it.</p>

                <h2>Day 62 - 16 July 2025</h2>
                <p>I merged all my small projects in Ruby into one repository. It's what actually took most of my time, but at least it's orgainzed.</p>
                <p>I already looked at the next lesson, and it's alll about Bubble Sort. Will continue the project next time.</p>

                <h2>Day 63 - 17 July 2025</h2>
                <p>Finished the simple bubble sort. It was an easy project since bubble sorting is a simple algorithm. The next lesson is entitled: "Object Oriented Programming", so back to OOP for me!</p>

                <h2>Day 64 - 18 July 2025</h2>
                <p>Started with OOP in Ruby. Blows my mind that I can create classes and objects on my own, and then define and use them however I need them. The Ruby language is also helpful and very intuitive. I haven't finished the whole lesson yet, and I'll continue it next time.</p>
