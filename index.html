                <h2>Day 2 - August 30, 2023</h2> <i>(Because we only started coding in HTML today.)</i>
                    <!-- This is the practical uses of what I've learned so far, as well as the assignment part. It's also nice to keep a journal of my journey with me. -->
                <p>Today, we finally started coding our first website. Well, this is not <em>the first website</em> I've made. I've made several "first" websites in my life and I have this one because I'm starting again afresh on my web dev career path. If only I could practice, learn, and code all day long, up until I start learning something new. In any case, I'm here and I'm starting again. I hope I'm not starting too late, because the future, our (28M 25F) future will depend on it.</p>
                
                <p>So far, we talked about paragraph, headings, strong and emphasis, nesting elements, and comments, all of which I already know. We also have lists, which I also know, but for the assignment:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>An unordered shopping list of your favorite foods</b></li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Pepperoni Pizza</li>
                            <ul>
                            <li>ingredients to make dough</li>
                            <li>tomato sauce and paste</li>
                            <li>fresh cheese</li>
                            <li>savory sausages for the pepperoni ('cause pepperoni isn't readily available here)</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Pasta (Carbonara)</li>
                            <ul>
                            <li>pasta</li>
                            <li>egg</li>
                            <li>cheese</li>
                            <li>ham and bacon (I know the proper meat but also not readily available here)</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Potatoes (mash, fried, or what have you)</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    <li><b>An ordered list of todo's you need to get done today</b></li>
                        <ol>
                        <li>do laundry</li>
                        <li>learn more about coding</li>
                        <li>pick bibi up after work</li>
                        <li>play some games as downtime</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>An unordered list of places you'd like to visit someday</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>S. Korea (for bibi)</li>
                        <li>Japan</li>
                        <li>Rome, Italy</li>
                        <li>Palawan</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>An ordered list of your all time top 5 favorite video games or movies</li>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Half-Life</li>
                        <li>Valheim</li>
                        <li>The Elder Scrolls</li>
                        <li>Fallout</li>
                        <li>Red Dead Redemption</li>
                        </ol>
                </ol>
                <p>Moving on from lists, we also have links and images, which I also know. I remember where we had to link webpages and have them load on a particular part of the index file. Those were fun times during high school. To think that everything I was taught back then would still be active right now. Of course we did do it on notepad, but it was part of the fun, trying to debug the code when something messed up. Fun times hehe. Anyways, here's the link to work on that section: <a href="odin-links-and-images/index-for-links-images.html">Odin Links and Images</a></p>
                <br>
                <h2>Day 3 - September 1, 2023</h2>
                    <!-- This is finally the start of the actual dev blog. -->
                <p>Last time, I already started the first project, which was Odin's Recipes. I filled it with recipes from Valheim, a game my fiance and I play a lot (plus it has that viking theme already). I finished up that project today and submitted it to Odin.</p>
                <p>I had a couple of hiccups, though. Like the files not pushing to GitHub and missing blobs. I was definitely dumbfounded but luckily Google was there and so were the strangers that had that similar problem before (thanks strangers!). Now I know how to re-hash files if ever they're corrupt (did I get that right?) Apparently my laptop BSOD-ed itself, corrupting my files. A little panic, but was able to go through with it.</p>
                <p>Today, we start with CSS, and hopefully I do it right this time. Because when I had a go with it, I got it pretty well, but my designed were uuuuuugly. Hopefully they got better as the years went by.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Day 5 (?) - September 6, 2023</h2>
                <p>I haven't had any real time to study coding up until now. I was busy focusing on looking for a part-time while I study. I have a wedding to save up for hehe</p>
                <p>Anyway, I finished forking the CSS exercises from GitHub and I'll now focus on them. Updates later.</p>
                <p><b>Updates:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>01-css-methods was done without any hitch.</li> <li>02-class-id-selectors got a small mistake. I was supposed to add a general class to some elements, but I figured that since they were all paragraphs, I would just use paragraph. Optimized but didn't follow the code. Also, I could've used a class with one of the ID items. I forgot that you can still add classes even if some items have IDs. </li>
                    <li>03-grouping-selectors also hit a snag. I chained the selectors instead of gruping them. </li>
                    <li>04-chaining-selectors was good. I got it thanks to the mistake in exercise 3.</li>
                </ul>
                I had to stop there because I needed to rest. Till next time!
                </p>
                <h2>Day 6 - September 7, 2023</h2>
                <p>I started with my job today while coding, so my schedule is going to be more stable than before. This probably means that I'll be more consistent in studying and practicing my code. Yay!</p>
                <p>Continuing for last time, I'll start with exercise 5.</p>
                <p><b>Updates:</b><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>05-descendant-combinator was done smoothly.</li>
                    <li>06-cascade-fix is also done.</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>Alright! I'm done with the CSS exercises. I'm ready to move on tomorrow.</p>
                <h2>Day 7 - September 8, 2023</h2>
                <p>I'm moving on to the Cascade in CSS. After reading the page, I found out that I was supposed to do exercise 06 during <em>THIS</em> part of the course. Should have read the instructions more carefully.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the assignment asked us to style the first project,Odin Recipes, and I did just that. I'm not done yet though, and I think I'll finish tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Day 8 - September 13, 2023</h2>
                <p>Currently sick at home. Decided to code after a few days not coding.</p>
                <p>Finished the CSS in project 1. It's just basic designing but I still have some ideas on how to make it better. As I learn more, hopefully I come back and edit them to become better.</p>
                <p>I've also finished the lessons involing the Dev Tools in browser. Very very very very help, to say the least. Definitely something I see myself seeing every day.</p>
                <p>I still need to code this journey. I'll probably do it some time. I'm thinking of having it like a journal or a scroll. At least something that really looks like a journey journal or memoir. Till next time!</p>

                <h2>Day 9 - September 18, 2023</h2>
                <p>Studied the Box Model today. Definitely would have been better if I knew about this before. Now I know the differences of margin, border, and padding, as well as the display attribute.</p>

                <h2>Day 10 - September 19, 2023</h2>
                <p>Just a quick lesson as I used most of my study time into bettering my budgeting sheet by including a table for each transaction, then automating the net received, the totals of net, total of trips made, payment method used by the customer, and, the computed cash based on the payment method. I then fixed some formulas to accomdate the changes.</p>
                <p>Right now, I'm still studying the Box of CSS, particularly Block and Inline.</p>
                <p>Now, I'm doing the exercises for margin and padding.
                    <ul>
                        <li>01-margin-and-padding-1 was almost perfect. I learned that if you used [margin-left: auto;], elements would align to the right. </li>
                        <li>02-margin-and-padding-2 is still unfinished. Will continue tomorrow.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Day 11 - September 20, 2023</h2>
                <p>Finished the two exercises for the block. 02-margin-and-padding-2 needed a little work, but it was a good thing I learned about the Chrome Dev Tools. It was definitely helpful trying to figure out what was giving the weird spacing. Other than that, it went smoothly.</p>
                <p>Now the next assignment is to work on Project 1 to make it better, and that's what I'll focus on today.</p>

                <h2>Day 12 - September 21, 2023</h2>
                <p>Finished styling Project 1. Made me realize that a lot of the time I'm styling, making errors, fixing them, double-checking on the file it it appears correctly. I know there are some tools that will definitely make this a lot better, but for now, I'm happy that I could do it. It's made me happy to style a project.</p>
                <p>Now about styling this blog...?</p>
